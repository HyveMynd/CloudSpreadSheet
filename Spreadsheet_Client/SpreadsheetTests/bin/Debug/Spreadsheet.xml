            <summary>
            An AbstractSpreadsheet object represents the state of a simple spreadsheet.  A 
            spreadsheet consists of an infinite number of named cells.
            
            A string is a cell name if and only if it consists of one or more letters, 
            followed by a non-zero digit, followed by zero or more digits.
            
            For example, "A15", "a15", "XY32", and "BC7" are cell names.  (Note that despite
            their similarity, "A15" and "a15" are different cell names.)  On the other hand, 
            "Z", "X07", and "hello" are not cell names."
            
            A spreadsheet contains a cell corresponding to every possible cell name.  
            In addition to a name, each cell has a contents and a value.  The distinction is
            important.
            
            The contents of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a Formula.  If the
            contents is an empty string, we say that the cell is empty.  (By analogy, the contents
            of a cell in Excel is what is displayed on the editing line when the cell is selected.)
            
            In a new spreadsheet, the contents of every cell is the empty string.
             
            The value of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a FormulaError.  
            (By analogy, the value of an Excel cell is what is displayed in that cell's position
            in the grid.)
            
            If a cell's contents is a string, its value is that string.
            
            If a cell's contents is a double, its value is that double.
            
            If a cell's contents is a Formula, its value is either a double or a FormulaError,
            as reported by the Evaluate method of the Formula class.  The value of a Formula,
            of course, can depend on the values of variables.  The value of a variable is the 
            value of the spreadsheet cell it names (if that cell's value is a double) or 
            is undefined (otherwise).
            
            Spreadsheets are never allowed to contain a combination of Formulas that establish
            a circular dependency.  A circular dependency exists when a cell depends on itself.
            For example, suppose that A1 contains B1*2, B1 contains C1*2, and C1 contains A1*2.
            A1 depends on B1, which depends on C1, which depends on A1.  That's a circular
            dependency.

            Otherwise, if name isn't a valid cell name, throws an InvalidNameException.
            
            Otherwise, returns an enumeration, without duplicates, of the names of all cells whose
            values depend directly on the value of the named cell.  In other words, returns
            an enumeration, without duplicates, of the names of all cells that contain
            formulas containing name.
            
            For example, suppose that
            A1 contains 3
            B1 contains the formula A1 * A1
            C1 contains the formula B1 + A1
            D1 contains the formula B1 - C1
            The direct dependents of A1 are B1 and C1

            Requires that names be non-null.  Also requires that if names contains s,
            then s must be a valid non-null cell name.
            
            If any of the named cells are involved in a circular dependency,
            throws a CircularException.
            
            Otherwise, returns an enumeration of the names of all cells whose values must
            be recalculated, assuming that the contents of each cell named in names has changed.
            The names are enumerated in the order in which the calculations should be done.  
            
            For example, suppose that 
            A1 contains 5
            B1 contains 7
            C1 contains the formula A1 + B1
            D1 contains the formula A1 * C1
            E1 contains 15
            
            If A1 and B1 have changed, then A1, B1, and C1, and D1 must be recalculated,
            and they must be recalculated in either the order A1,B1,C1,D1 or B1,A1,C1,D1.
            The method will produce one of those enumerations.
            
            Please note that this method depends on the abstract GetDirectDependents.
            It won't work until GetDirectDependents is implemented correctly.
